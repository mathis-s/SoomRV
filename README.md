# SoomRV
## Description
SoomRV is a simple superscalar Out-of-Order RISC-V microprocessor. It can execute up to 4 instructions per cycle completely out of order, and also supports speculative execution and precise exceptions.

## Basic Architecture

## Features
- RV32IMACZicsrZifenceiZbaZbbZicbomZfinx Instruction Set
- 4-wide superscalar OoO Execution (tag-indexed register file, load after issue)
- Fully Out-of-Order Load/Store
- TAGE Branch Predictor
- Supports Instruction and Data Cache
- Implements RISC-V Privileged Spec (M/S/U mode, virtual memory, boots Linux)
- Currently scores 10.256 DMIPS/MHz at 2.721 IPC (`-march=rv32imac_zicsr_zba_zbb -O3 -finline-limit=128`, using `strcmp` implemented in `test_programs/entry.s`)

## Simulating
1. Install the [RV32 Linux Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) as well as Verilator (at least version 5.0).
2. Run `make setup` to build submodules.
3. Run `make` to build a binary with Verilator (alternatively, `make trace` will also generate VCD traces)
4. To run bare-metal code, use `./obj_dir/VTop <assembly file>`.  
For example, run `./obj_dir/VTop test_programs/dhry_1.s` to run Dhrystone.
5. To build and run Linux, use `make linux`. Log in as `root`, no password.  
Building Linux and booting it in simulation takes at least a few hours!

### Console
The console input is line-buffered for easier input at the low speed of simulation. Within Linux,
you will thus see all input lines twice.

### Save/Restore (experimental)
While running, the simulator will save its state about once a minute if 
`--backup-file=<NAME>.backup` is specified. Simulation can then be restarted
at the backup by running `./obj_dir/VTop <NAME>.backup`. The file name must
end with `.backup`. If cosim is enabled, a matching `.backup_cosim` file will
be written/read as well.

This is on by default for `make linux`. To restart a crashed or closed Linux boot
at the last checkpoint, use e.g. `./obj_dir/VTop soomrv.backup --backup-file=soomrv2.backup`.
(There seem to be some spurious segfaults in the Verilator-generated code.)
